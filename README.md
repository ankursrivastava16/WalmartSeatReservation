# WalmartSeatReservation

## Assumptions

* Since i have not used an in memory DB or SQL/No SQL DB to save the availaible or occupied seats ,  i implemented Mutlimap for Seat allocation /De allocation.Also seats will be filled in sequential manner like 1st row ,2nd row and till the 10th row.Users are not allowed to select seats of their choice , since in the method signatures , i didnt find any info like that.I have implemented the use case as per the method signatures specified in the problem statement.
* I have specified  property in the properties file for row and columns .They are 10 X 10.
* In  the program , i am running the first 5 requests as static for seat hold id 1 to 5 and then there is a prompt to accept user level input.Based on that seats will be reserved and allocated .

## How to run

* Please import the above project as a Maven project in Eclipse.
* Go to to the project root folder in Terminal or Command Line and execute "mvn clean install".
* As its an exceutable jar , then run the command "java -jar target\seatreservation.jar".
